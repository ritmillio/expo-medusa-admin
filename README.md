## TODO list
#### This repository is still under development. If you would like to help me build this app please scroll down to contribute section and follow instructions.
Initial design:
>Same as on Shopify mobile app.
1. Create a login screen with the same authentication as on Medusa Admin. User should be able to login via email&password or quick login with Google Auth. -> Priority (high)
2. Home Page - User should be able to see todays total order number and some chart with the weekly orders -> Priority: (high)
3. Create an Order Screen - User should be able to see all the orders -> Priority: (high)
4. Order notification - If shop receives an order user should get an instant notification about that order with the following details(order created date, total value, order number) -> Priority (medium)
5. Splash Screen -> Medusa logo -> Priority: (high) - DONE
6. Products Screen -> 1st iteration --> User should be able to see all the products. 2nd iteration --> User should be able to edit, delete and add new product.
7. Store Screen --> 
	a. Customers Screen --> User should be able to see all customers (prio - low)
	b. Analytics Screen --> Charts about total sales/daily sales etc. (prio - low)
